# Flight Prices 
### Project Description

This project aimed to answer the question what is the optimal number of days before departure to book a flight for the lowest fare?

A large Flight Prices data set was used to answer the question. The data was explored and cleaned in a Jupyter Notebook create in PyCharm. The Python Dask library was used to increase data processing speeds. Much of the EDA and cleaning focused on reducing the data set to a size that could be uploaded within the file size restrictions for Looker Studio.  Creative problem solving and strategic thinking helped to shrink the dataset while keeping the data variety needed to answer the business question. 

The cleaned data was presented in a dashboard created in Looker Studio. The dynamic filters on the dashboard allow the user to decide what criteria is most important to them when determining the optimal number of days before departure to book.
