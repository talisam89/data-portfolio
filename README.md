### Business Problem
What is the optimal number of days before departure to book a flight for the lowest fare?
### Project Summary
A large Flight Prices data set from Kaggle was used to answer the question. The data was explored and cleaned in a Jupyter Notebook create in PyCharm. The Python Dask library was used to increase data processing speeds. Much of the EDA and cleaning focused on reducing the data set to a size that could be uploaded within the file size restrictions for Looker Studio.  Creative problem solving and strategic thinking helped to shrink the dataset while keeping the data variety needed to answer the business question. The cleaned data was presented in a Looker Studio dashboard that split the data by airline and allowed the user to filter by departure and destination airport.
