### Business Problem
What is the optimal number of days before departure to book a flight for the lowest fare?
### Project Summary
A large Flight Prices data set from Kaggle was used to answer the question. The data was explored and cleaned in a Jupyter Notebook create in PyCharm. The Python Dask library was used to increase data processing speeds. Much of the EDA and cleaning focused on reducing the data set to a size that could be uploaded within the file size restrictions for Looker Studio.  Creative problem solving and strategic thinking helped to shrink the dataset while keeping the data variety needed to answer the business question. The cleaned data was presented in a Looker Studio dashboard that split the data by airline and allowed the user to filter by departure and destination airport.

### Project Conclusion
The optimal number of days before departure to book a flight is 21 to 28 days (3-4 weeks) before departure. However the price varies by only a few dollars until 7-14 days before departure, and may be a negligible difference for most customers. 

There is variation depending on the departure location and destination as well as the airline. When flying from JFK to LAX the optimal number of days to book a flight is 14 to 21 days (2-3 weeks) before departure.  Airlines like Frontier, American and JetBlue seem to keep their prices relatively steady, whereas airlines like Delta and Spirit have large jumps in prices as the purchase date gets closer to the departure date. 

It should be noted that these conclusions only apply to nonstop flights in coach and were drawn using data from 2022.
